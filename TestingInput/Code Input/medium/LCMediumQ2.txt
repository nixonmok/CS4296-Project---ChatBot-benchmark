Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9

Here is the provided code of the the solution. Please finish it in python in order to find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
class Solution(object):
    def searchRange(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
