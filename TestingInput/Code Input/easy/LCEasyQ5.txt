Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Here is the provided code of the the solution. Please finish it in python in order to return the majority element.
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
