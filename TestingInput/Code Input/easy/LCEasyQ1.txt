Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

Here is the provided code of the the solution. Please finish it in python in order to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
