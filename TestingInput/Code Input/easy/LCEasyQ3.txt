Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Here is the provided code of the the solution. Please finish it in python in order to determine if the input string is valid.
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
